Emercoin is a [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) platform supporting a wide range of distributed trusted services. Distinctive features include high reliability, robustness and 3-in-one hybrid mining (PoW+MergedMining+PoS). Currently, the Emercoin platform already runs the network security services
[EmcSSL](./Blockchain_Services/EmcSSL/EmcSSL_Introduction)/[EmcSSH](./Blockchain_Services/EmcSSH), decentralized
domain system [EmcDNS](./Blockchain_Services/EmcDNS/EmcDNS_Introduction), an anti-counterfeit solution
[EmcDPO](./Blockchain_Services/EmcDPO/EmcDPO_Introduction), VOIP solution [ENUMer](./Blockchain_Services/ENUMer), as well as several other [bundled blockchain services](./Blockchain_Services/Introduction_to_Emercoin_Services). At the heart of many of these innovations is the [Emercoin NVS](./Blockchain_Services/Emercoin_NVS) which allows for the arbitrary storage of **name-&gt;value** pairs on the blockchain.
